	abstract = {Joint models for longitudinal and survival data are particularly relevant to many cancer clinical trials and observational studies in which longitudinal biomarkers (eg, circulating tumor cells, immune response to a vaccine, and quality-of-life measurements) may be highly associated with time to event, such as relapse-free survival or overall survival. In this article, we give an introductory overview on joint modeling and present a general discussion of a broad range of issues that arise in the design and analysis of clinical trials using joint models. To demonstrate our points throughout, we present an analysis from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial E1193, as well as examine some operating characteristics of joint models through simulation studies.},

	abstract = {A common objective in longitudinal studies is to characterize the relationship between a longitudinal response process and a time-to-event. Considerable recent interest has focused on so-called joint models, where models for the event time distribution and longitudinal data are taken to depend on a common set of latent random effects. In the literature, precise statement of the underlying assumptions typically made for these models has been rare. We review the rationale for and development of joint models, offer insight into the structure of the likelihood for model parameters that clarifies the nature of common assumptions, and describe and contrast some of our recent proposals for implementation and inference.},
